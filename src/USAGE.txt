BEFORE RUNNING:

TODO-JS: describe what needs to be changed to the rules in the /etc/udev/rules.d
before running

Upload the read_sensor.ino code to the Arduino.

TO RUN:

* Open two terminals - one will be for actually running the bash file and one will
just be designated for killing the processes.

* In one terminal, type './run.sh'. This will run the entire system as well as the
video stream. On the first attempt upon booting the Pi, the sensor often has trouble
decoding the start byte. If that happens, just 'Ctrl+C' and rerun the command, it should
work.

* If the camera freezes at any point or the system has trouble reading from any device,
run the two error-handling bash files described in OVERVIEW.txt.

* To terminate the program, navigate to the second terminal, and type 'killall python3'
