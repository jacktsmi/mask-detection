This folder contains the two scripts initially used to interface the distance sensor with...
the Raspberry Pi Camera. They send person/no person information from the Arduino to the...
...Raspberry Pi based on sensor values and take a picture with the Raspberry Pi camera if a person is detected.

TODO-JS: remove the ino file, it's the exact same as the one in the sensor interface folder. We can just say the py file requires /updated_sensor_interface/read_sensor.ino to be uploaded to the Arudino.

TODO-JS: add header comments/general comments to files
